# **Introduction to integer arithmetic**

#Arithmetic operations aren't just for math class â€” they're super important in programming too! Whether you're calculating
# change at the store or figuring out the area of a room, arithmetic operations help you process numbers in programs.

#Multiplication = *Finding the area of a rectangle from its length and width.
#Addition = *Calculating the total expenses after shopping.
#Subtraction = *Determining the remaining amount of milk after making a cup of coffee.
#Division = *Calculating the average monthly revenue from the total yearly revenue.

# **Basic arithmetic operations**

#In the magical world of Python, you've got the power of basic arithmetic operations right at your fingertips! Think of it like
# having a fully functional calculator built into your code. Need to add, subtract, multiply, or divide? Python's got your back!

# **Addition and subtraction**

#Alright, let's dive into addition and subtraction in Python! With the "+" symbol, you can add values effortlessly, while the "-"
# symbol gracefully subtracts them. Some exaples:
a = 5
b = 3
print(a + b)
print(a - b, '\n')

# **Checking balance**

#Let's apply our new Python skill into practice. In the following code, we already defined two variables for you: total_money,
# and cost. Please calculate the current balance by subtracting the cost from the total money and print the result.
total_money = 100
cost = 50
print("The current balance is:",total_money - cost, 'Rands\n')

# **Monthly savings**

#Write a Python program that calculates your total savings over three months if you save 200 in the first month 150 in the 
# second month, and 250 in the third month. Print the total savings.
month_one = 150
month_two = 200
month_three = 250
print(month_one + month_two + month_three, 'Rands\n')

# **Multiplication and division**

#Let's move forward to the next set of operations. We know you may have guessed the symbols for multiplication and division.
# to be thorough, here are examples to illustrate multiplication and division:
length = 12
width = 6
print(length * width)
print(length / width, '\n')
