# **Let's say Hello**

#Python, developed by Guido van Rossum in 1991, is loved by beginners and experts alike for its readable code and concise
#syntax. This language is so versatile that it can power websites, analyze data, build machine learning models, automate tasks,
#create games, and even control robots! 💻
#Please pay close attention to the syntax here. Notice the keyword print, the parentheses, and the quotation marks. Got it?

print("Hello World!")
print('I am learning Python')


# **Mind the indentation**

#Even the simplest lines of code can trip you up with sneaky errors. 
#So, we must learn about them to write better code.
#One common mistake is extra indentation!

#    print("Hello World!"
#This won't work because of those extra spaces before print.)

#In Python, think of print as a magic spell: you write the word print, and voila! ✨ Text appears on your screen.
#Now, here's the cool part: you can use this spell over and over again, wherever you need it in your code. In Python language, we
#call such a spell a function. So, when you see print() with those parentheses, it's like casting the spell to print something to
#the screen. Cool, right? 😎
#Each print() function will print on a new line.

# **Can I give you a Nickname?**
#Oops! Calling a function by the wrong name is another common mistake! 🤦‍♂️

#pint("Hello, World!")
#Looks like we’re ordering a drink instead of printing text! 🍺 It should be print, not pint.

# **Mark the finish line please.**

#Uh-oh! Looks like we forgot to close our string! 😬
#print("Python) 
#This won't work because it’s like starting a sentence and never finishing it.
#Always make sure your strings are properly enclosed in quotes. 📝
print("Coding is Fun!")
